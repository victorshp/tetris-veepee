This is a clone of the famous Tetris game with some minor modifications built with vanilla JavaScript on top of the Rails framework.

To play it, you can access it [here](https://tetris-veepee.herokuapp.com/)

It's free. If you want to talk to me or just have a question, PM me at [@vic_shpark](https://twitter.com/vic_shpark) on Twitter.
